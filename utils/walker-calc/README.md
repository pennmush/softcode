Written by Walker@M\*U\*S\*H. 

A calculator with both typical expression calculating (3 + sin(12) * PI^2)) and graphing, plotting calculation points on a graph. It also has a function to turn any mathematical expression it understands into mushcode. e.g: It will turn 2+2*4 into add(2,mul(2,4)).

The math-related functions are in the Math Chip object, and that can be @parented to to obtain u(calc,<expression>). Math Chip contains no $-commands, while Graphing Calculator contains all the UI and the code for graphing functions.
