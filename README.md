# softcode
An assortment of softcode deemed interesting, unique, useful or widespread enough to be of use to PennMUSH users.

## FAQ

### What's this?

This repository contains softcode written for PennMUSHes which the PennMUSH developers believe is either interesting, unique, useful, or widespread enough to be worth sharing with all PennMUSH users. The PennMUSH devs are the arbiters of what does or does not match that criteria.

### Who wrote the code here?
Some of it was written by the PennMUSH devs, to supply features that were deemed useful but not worth adding to the hardcode. Some is written by other MUSHers and shared here to make it available to other PennMUSH users.

### Can I submit code?
Absolutely! You can either:
  * Clone the repository, add your code to the right place, and submit a Pull Request
  * Open an Issue and link to (but please NOT paste in) your code

Any code submitted should include a license (either an &attribute in the code, or elsewhere in the file) to give permission for it to be shared and used/modified.

### Can I request something new be coded?
You can, but don't hold your breath :)

### Can I request a new feature/addition/change to some code here?
You can, but unless it's deemed widely useful and we happen to be the authors of the original code, it's unlikely to happen. For code submitted by others, you could try contacting the original author, if they supplied contact details.

Unfortunately, the Penn devs aren't able to write or modify softcode specifically for your game. Sorry.

### What can I do with the code here?
The code in this repository should contain a license, either in a separate file or as part of the code. If it doesn't, it's free for use, and you should contact the author for anything else.

### I've found a bug!
Open an Issue and let us know, or if you'd really like us to love you, submit a Pull Request with a fix.
